My name is Damian Matysko and here is my elevator solution. In this solution I used Java and the lift is demonstrated in the terminal. 
Passengers approach the elevator and stand in line. The elevator carries each passenger one at a time. The following scenarios have been implemented:
1. The elevator is on a different floor than the passengers - the elevator will begin to rise or fall to the desired floor.
2. The elevator is already on the required floor - then it immediately works with the passenger.
3. The elevator informs the user of its user actions through the console.
Implemented 4 floors, this number can be easily increased.
Ideas for improvement - modify the code so that the elevator works with several people, instead of one and in turn. This means that if several passengers want to get off on the same floor, they can do this and only those passengers who were intended for this will leave the elevator.
